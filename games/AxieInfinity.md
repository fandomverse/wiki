## What are Axies
Axies a digital pet where players battle, raise, and trade fantasy creatures called Axies. Players can engage in a 3v3 turn base auto-battle using cards as supports. The system is set up similar to classic RPG of using different roles like tanks, DPS and support role with blend of Pokemon elemental strengths and weakness. 


### Rarity
All Axies are unique NFT, meaning their value differs greatly based on traits, stats and quantity. These plays a pivotal role in-game performance and the market value of each creatures.

### Stats
Each Axie has 4 stats, Health, Morale, Skill, and Speed.

Here’s what they do:

HP- The amount of damage your Axie can take before being knocked out.

Morale- Morale increases critical strike chance. It also makes entering last stand more likely and adds more last stand “ticks”.

Skill- Skill adds damage when an Axie plays multiple cards at once (combo). The extra damage is calculated like this: (card attack * skill )/ 500

Speed- Speed determines turn order. Faster Axies attack first. If two Axies have the same speed, this is how attack order is determined: High speed > Low HP > High Skill > High Morale > Low Fighter ID

An Axie’s stats are dependent on two variables: its class and its body parts.

### Body Parts
Each Axie has 6 body parts: eyes, ears, horn, mouth, back, and tail.

Horns, Mouths, Backs, and Tails determine which cards an Axie can use in battle.

Each body part adds stats depending on the class of the part:

### Classes
Similar to Pokemon, Axie comes in different classes with advantage and disadvantage	against other types. The bonus is 15% more or less depending on type. 

In addition, when an Axie of a certain class uses a card from its class it gets a 10% attack/shield bonus. For example, a Plant Axie playing a plant card will receive 10% extra attack/shield.

Important to note is that these bonuses stack. A Beast Axie using a Beast card against a Plant target will do 25% (10% + 15%) more damage.

Classes also effect the stats that an Axie has. Please review this sheet for an overview of how the stat & class system work.

## Gameplay
Axies has two modes for players to enjoy: Adventure (solo mode) and Arena (pvp mode)

We are covering the Arena mode. This is divided into two parts:

The Setup Phase is where players can conduct strategies with the cards and their Axie

The **Battle Phase** is an auto-battler where you can cheer on your team and watch their setup play-out against the opponent.

## Breeding 
This is another key feature that many player focus on, since this is the primary source to generate the sale or improve your competitive edge	in-game. Every Axie has the ability to breed with another up to 6x with use of Smooth Love Potion (SLP). SLP is a cryptocurrency	on the Ronin blockchain.
